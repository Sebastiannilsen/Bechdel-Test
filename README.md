# Bechdeltest_movie_scripts

## Description

A project using two different methods to analyzing movies performance based on their bechdel test score.

{Insert text about bechdel test}

## Visuals

Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

{Could be cool to put some screenshots of the jupyter book and streamlit stuff}

## Installation

Make sure to have pipenv installed on your computer. More info [here](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/install/).

```
pipenv shell
```

```
pipenv install
```

```
streamlit run StreamLitVisualizer.py
```

## Usage

Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

{If we have time}

## Roadmap

If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.

## Authors and acknowledgment

Show your appreciation to those who have contributed to the project.
